		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A thorough security and technical analysis was done of Kevin Lee's app for notuber.  Notuber is an app
			designed to work like uber.  It takes in coordinates from both passengers and vehicles, and depending
			on the role of the user, will reveal to them the locations on a map of either the passengeres or 
			vehicles.  It was found that
			he had several issues with his app.  While some of these flaws had to do with privacy and security,
			others were simply tied to his code not handling certain "edge" cases as far as inputing and storing
			data.</p> 
		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>An attempted Cross-Site scripted attack was attempted to reveal any significant errors in the server's
			code.  The "malicious" script that was attempted to be inserted was simply a call to open up a 
			pop-up window.  Additionally, a mongodb injection was done to identify any security breaches in the way
			the server was storing the data.  To do this a query was done with the GET path "/json.passenger".
			Finally, a simple read-over of the code was done to reveal any other blatant issues with the code that
		would have lead to security breachings. </p>
		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p>There were a couple issues with the application's code.  Firstly, his code was unable to appropriately
			respond to situations where the client sends a non-number as a coordinate for either the longitude or
			latitude.  Secondly, the application's server crashes if a mongodb injection is attempted (which is
			essentially an attempt to access the information in the database of the server).  While it is in
			theory better that the server crashes than provide a malicious user information that they should not
			have access to, it still fails to protect itself from a mongodb injection since the server ends up
			crashing.  Lastly, the application as a whole is not very secure since it enables full, unrestricted
			cross-orgin resource sharing (CORS).  This means that a user from any domain can access the assets
			on the applications' server.  Though it was important to do this for the sake of the application's
		purpose, enabling unrestricted CORS could lead to a major security breach.</p>
