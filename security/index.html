		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A thorough security and technical analysis was done of Kevin Lee's app for notuber.  Notuber is an app
			designed to work like uber.  It takes in coordinates from both passengers and vehicles, and depending
			on the role of the user, will reveal to them the locations on a map of either the passengeres or 
			vehicles.  It was found that
			he had several issues with his app.  While some of these flaws had to do with privacy and security,
			others were simply tied to his code not handling certain "edge" cases as far as inputing and storing
			data.</p> 
		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>An attempted Cross-Site scripted attack was attempted to reveal any significant errors in the server's
			code.  The "malicious" script that was attempted to be inserted was simply a call to open up a 
			pop-up window.  Additionally.....  Finally, a simple read-over of the code was done to reveal any
			other blatant issues with the code that would have lead to security breachings.
